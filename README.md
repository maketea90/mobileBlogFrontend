# Welcome to my mobile blog app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This app is coded in React Native and makes calls to an api (also written by me) hosted at 'https://ancient-lake-71305-93605de8b47e.herokuapp.com/'

Link to api code: https://github.com/maketea90/mobileBlog

## To launch the app

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

If the command in step 2 doesn't work, try:

npx expo start --tunnel

Then open the app either in the browser by typing 'w' or on your phone by scanning the qr code with the expo go app.
